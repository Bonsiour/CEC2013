For each algorithm there are two files with the PR,SR values produced for the
competition:

- Each <algorithm name>_PR.dat contains the Average Peak Ratio values for each
problem and each accuracy level.
- Each <algorithm name>_SR.dat contains the Average Success Rate values for each
problem and each accuracy level.

The structure of the files contain a tab-separated matrix (20 x 5, 20 problems
x 5 accuracy levels) e.g.:

for all problems and each accuracy level: IMAGINE_PR.dat

1.0    1.0    1.0    1.0    1.0
1.0    0.999    0.998    0.997    0.996
...
...


Similarly for the IMAGINE_SR.dat:

1.0    1.0    1.0    1.0    1.0
1.0    0.99    0.99    0.99    0.99
...
...
